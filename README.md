# Linear-Regression-Model-Salary-Prediction
This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a Linear Regression model used to predict salary based on years of experience.

The dataset consists of two variables: Experience (years) and Salary.

This script performs the following steps:

    Creates a small dataset containing Experience and Salary values.
    Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
    Trains a Linear Regression model on the training data.
    Predicts the salaries on the test data.
    Computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model's performance.

Installation
    To run the script, you'll need to install the required Python libraries:
    Clone this repository to your local machine
    Run the Python script

Results
After running the script, it will output:
    The predicted salaries based on the test data.
    The Mean Squared Error (MSE), which indicates how well the model performed.
